# Implementation of a Solar Power Modelling Application with LightningChart Python

## Introduction

Solar power modeling is a computational approach that helps in predicting and optimizing the performance of solar energy systems. It involves the use of mathematical and simulation models to forecast the power output of solar panels under various environmental and operational conditions. By understanding and anticipating the behavior of solar power systems, engineers and researchers can design more efficient solar energy installations, maximize energy production, and reduce operational costs (Tripathi et al., 2024).

One of the primary ways solar power modeling contributes to system optimization is through the accurate prediction of power output. By analyzing historical weather data and real-time environmental inputs, solar power models can forecast daily, monthly, and annual energy yields. This allows operators to make informed decisions regarding energy storage, grid integration, and maintenance schedules, ensuring the system operates at peak efficiency (Al-Shahri et al., 2021).

Several critical variables are required for accurate solar power modeling, including:
- **Solar Irradiance**: The amount of solar energy received per unit area at a given location. It is a crucial factor influencing the energy production of solar panels.
- **Temperature**: Both ambient and module temperatures affect the efficiency of solar panels. High temperatures can reduce the efficiency, while lower temperatures might enhance it, depending on the panel type.
- **Panel Orientation**: The angle and direction in which solar panels are installed significantly impact the amount of sunlight they receive, thus affecting their power output.
- **Shading**: Obstructions such as buildings, trees, or other structures that cast shadows on solar panels can reduce the energy output by blocking sunlight.
- **System Specifications**: These include the technical characteristics of the solar panels, inverters, and other system components, which determine the overall efficiency and performance of the solar power system.

Solar power modeling is applied in various fields, including residential and commercial solar energy projects, large-scale solar farms, and grid integration studies. It is also used for policy-making, financial analysis, and in the development of renewable energy solutions to ensure sustainable energy production.

### Loading and Processing Data

### How to Load the Data Files

The data used in this project includes solar power generation data and weather sensor data. These datasets are merged based on timestamps to align power generation metrics with environmental conditions. The merged data is then prepared for analysis by selecting relevant features such as daily yield, total yield, ambient temperature, and module temperature.(Solar Power Generation Data, n.d.)

``` python
import pandas as pd
generation_data = pd.read_csv('Dataset/Plant_2_Generation_Data.csv')

## Visualizing Data with LightningChart

### Introduction to LightningChart for Python

LightningChart provides an efficient way to visualize large datasets in real-time, which is crucial for applications like sonar object recognition.

### Creating the Charts

## Scatter Plots and Time Series Analysis: 
The first set of diagrams focuses on the relationship between AC power and various factors such as time, irradiation, module temperature, ambient temperature, daily yield, and total yield. These scatter plots help visualize the distribution and correlation between these variables, crucial for understanding how environmental factors influence solar power output.
Script Summary: The scatter plots were generated using the following script, which creates charts for each pair of variables:

``` python
def create_scatter_chart(dashboard, title, x_values, y_values, xlabel, ylabel, column_index, row_index):
    chart = dashboard.ChartXY(column_index=column_index, row_index=row_index)
    chart.set_title(title)
    scatter_series = chart.add_point_series().add(x_values, y_values).set_point_color(lc.Color(0, 0, 255, 128)).set_point_size(2)
    chart.get_default_x_axis().set_title(xlabel)
    chart.get_default_y_axis().set_title(ylabel)
```

![](Images/Scatter-Plots-and-Time-Series-Analysis.png)


These scatter plots reveal the following insights:
•	AC Power vs. Time: Displays a clear diurnal pattern with peaks around midday, indicating the correlation between sunlight availability and power output.
•	AC Power vs. Irradiation: Shows a strong positive correlation, confirming that higher solar irradiance leads to increased power generation.
•	AC Power vs. Module Temperature: Indicates a direct relationship, with power output increasing as module temperature rises, up to a certain point.
•	AC Power vs. Ambient Temperature: Also shows a positive correlation, though less pronounced than with module temperature.
•	AC Power vs. Daily Yield and Total Yield: These plots show that higher cumulative yields are associated with higher power outputs.

## Feature Importance Analysis: 

The second set of diagrams analyzes feature importance using various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Ensemble Methods. These bar charts visualize the importance of each feature in predicting AC power.
Script Summary: The feature importance was extracted from each model and plotted as follows:

``` python
def add_feature_importance_to_dashboard(dashboard, model_name, importances, column_index, row_index):
    importance_df = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': features.columns, 'Importance': importances}).sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)
    chart = dashboard.BarChart(column_index=column_index, row_index=row_index).set_title(f'{model_name} Feature Importances')
    bar_data = [{'category': str(row['Feature']), 'value': float(row['Importance'])} for _, row in importance_df.iterrows()]
    chart.set_data(bar_data)
```

Key observations include:
•	Irradiation consistently emerges as the most significant feature across models, emphasizing its critical role in predicting power output.
•	Ambient Temperature and Module Temperature also contribute, though to a lesser extent.

## Grid Layout of Density and Scatter Plots: 

This diagram is a grid layout combining multiple density and scatter plots, offering a detailed analysis of the interactions between key variables such as DAILY_YIELD, TOTAL_YIELD, AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE, and MODULE_TEMPERATURE. Each cell in the grid shows either a scatter plot or a density plot, depending on whether the variables being compared are different or the same.
Script Summary: The grid layout was created using the following script:

``` python
def create_density_scatter_grid(merged_data):
    dashboard = lc.Dashboard(rows=len(features), columns=len(features), theme=lc.Themes.Dark)
    for row_index, y_col in enumerate(features):
        for column_index, x_col in enumerate(features):
            if row_index == column_index:
                values_dict = {key: merged_data[merged_data['SOURCE_KEY_x'] == key][x_col].astype(float).tolist() for key in source_keys}
                create_density_chart(dashboard, f'Density of {x_col}', values_dict, column_index, row_index)
            else:
                data_dict = {key: (merged_data[merged_data['SOURCE_KEY_x'] == key][x_col].astype(float).tolist(),
                                   merged_data[merged_data['SOURCE_KEY_x'] == key][y_col].astype(float).tolist()) for key in source_keys}
                create_scatter_chart(dashboard, f'{x_col} vs {y_col}', data_dict, x_col, y_col, column_index, row_index)
    dashboard.open()
```

## Predictions vs. Actuals: 

The third set of diagrams compares the predicted AC power against actual values using various models. This is crucial for evaluating model accuracy.
Script Summary: This comparison is visualized through scatter plots of predicted vs. actual values, including an ideal line for reference:

``` python
def add_prediction_vs_actual_to_dashboard(dashboard, model_name, model, column_index, row_index):
    pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
    chart = dashboard.ChartXY(column_index=column_index, row_index=row_index).set_title(f'{model_name} Predictions vs Actual')
    pred_series = chart.add_point_series().add(y_test.tolist(), y_pred.tolist()).set_point_size(2)
    line_series = chart.add_line_series().add([min_val, max_val], [min_val, max_val]).set_line_color(lc.Color(255, 102, 102))
```

![](Images/Predictions-vs.-Actuals.png)

Results indicate that:
